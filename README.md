# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an 'O' or an 'X' in one square of a grid
consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.
This can be up, down, across or diagonally.
If neither player gets three symbols into a row but the game board is full, the game ends in a tie.
In this game the user is player X and plays against a computer, player O.

## PROJECT IDEA

My initial idea for this project was to build a simple and easy to undertsnad Tic Tac Toe game that the user can play against a computer.

The features I wanted the game to have are:

- Game navigations and controls are easy to understand
- Name input to make the experience more personal
- Rules explained so they are easy to follow and don't cause confusion
- Game gives feedback dependig on user input
- Computer opponent which the user plays against
